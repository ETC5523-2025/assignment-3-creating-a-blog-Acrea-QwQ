I am currently studying for a Master of Business Data Analytics at the Faculty of Business and Economics, Monash University. I am particularly interested in machine learning and predictive modeling.

Throughout my studies, I have developed skills in using R and tools such as tidyverse for data cleaning and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and visualization, and I use Quarto to write analytical reports. I also hope to further explore advanced topics such as machine learning and automated analytics to enhance my modeling and interpretive abilities.

I believe that learning data analysis is not only about acquiring technical skills, but also about developing a rational and objective way to understand data and the phenomena it represents. Through continuous practice, I aim to strengthen my ability in data exploration and visualization.
